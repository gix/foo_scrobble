//! An instance of a filesystem transaction. Inherits from filesystem API and provides all the methods. \n
//! To perform a transacted filesystem update, you must call methods on this object specifically - not static methods of filesystem class, not methods of a filesystem instance obtained from someplace else. \n
//! Call commit() when done, then release the object. If you release the object without having called commit(), the update will be rolled back. \n
//! Please keep in mind that you must not explicitly rely on this API and always provide a fallback mechanism. \n
//! A transacted operation may be impossible for the following reasons: \n
//! Too old foobar2000 version - filesystem_transacted was first published at version 1.4 beta 7 - obtaining a filesystem_transacted instance will fail. \n
//! Too old Windows OS - transacted APIs are available starting from Vista, not available on XP - obtaining a filesystem_transacted instance will fail. \n
//! Functionality disabled by user - obtaining a filesystem_transacted instance will fail. \n
//! The volume you're trying to work with does not support transacted updates - network share, non-NTFS USB stick, etc - create() will succeed but operations will fail with exception_io_transactions_unsupported. \n
